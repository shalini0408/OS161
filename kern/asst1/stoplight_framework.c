/**
 * This file contains the implementation of all the helper functions provided

 * 
 * Note that when testing your code, we will be using a fresh copy of this file.
 * You should ONLY change stoplight.c and synch.c in order to solve the synchronization
 * problem assignment.
 * 
 * That said, definitely go ahead and add custom tests to stoplight_custom function
 * at the bottom of this file. We will not use your custom tests during grading,
 * but checking your code more thoroughly can only ever be a good idea!
 * 
 * Feel free to read through the code in this file; it mostly consists of printing
 * the approach()/enter()/leave()/transfer() messages with a well-defined format,
 * plus the definition for each of the provided test cases.
