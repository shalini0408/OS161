PA1, Part 2 -- Exercise Questions 

1. Assume that the residents of Podunk are exceptional and follow the old (and widely ignored) convention that whoever arrives at the intersection 
first proceeds first. Using the language of synchronization primitives describe the way this intersection is controlled. In what ways is this 
method suboptimal?

In this model of the intersection, only one vehicle is in the intersection at a time. This means the entire intersection is the critical section 
that is protected by only one lock. This allows only one vehicle into the intersection at a time. The next vehicle cannot go until the first 
vehicle leaves and unlocks the intersection. Additionally, there is no concurrency in this model. For example, if a car from Route A approaches 
first and is turning right, no other car can enter the intersection, even if it wouldnâ€™t crash into the car turning right (if it was turning right 
from route B, for example). Lastly, there is a large amount of waiting because there is only one lock for the entire intersection. 

2. Now, assume that the residents of Podunk are like most people and do not follow the convention described above. In what one instance can this 
three-way-stop intersection produce a deadlock? (It will be helpful to think of this in terms of the model we are using instead of trying to 
visualize an actual intersection).

An example that causes deadlock is when a vehicle from each route is trying to turn left all at the same time. The vehicle from route A will 
acquire lock AB, the vehicle from route B will acquire BC, and the vehicle from route C will acquire lock CA. Because each vehicle holds a lock, 
they will be eternally waiting for the other lock that is already held by another vehicle. None of them can ever acquire the second lock, so no 
vehicle will ever complete the turn.
